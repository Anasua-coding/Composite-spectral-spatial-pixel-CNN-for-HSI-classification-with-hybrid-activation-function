# Here, a noble Composite Spectral Spatial Pixel CNN model for the classification of hyperspectral data is presented which is an amalgamation of 3D-2D-1D CNN. While the 3D and 2D CNN exploit the spectral-spatial features effectively, 1D CNN works on pixel-wise feature extraction.
# How to execute our code
1. We must first import a few Google credentials libraries.
2. After then, in order to access any files from Google Drive, we must obtain permission from the Gmail account. The created URL from the Gmail account must then be copied and pasted onto Google Colab.
3. Every single file has a unique ID, which can be found on Google Drive. We must copy the ID from Google Drive and then paste it on Google Colab if we wish to access a certain data collection.
4. In the next phase we have defined some functions like split of training testing ratio, dimension reduction technique and creating image cubes.
5. After that we have to fix some hyperparameters namely window size; number of bands; training ratio and testing ratio.
6. Afterwards we trained our Composite Spectral Spatial Pixel CNN model.
7. Finally we obtained the accuracy of our model and to visualize the predicted image and the ground truth image of that data set.
